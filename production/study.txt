- Subject: My Lost Ring

- My object is my ring that I got from my mother as a gift. I received it as a form of protection since it is my astrological birthstone: yellow sapphire. My mother had it made for me in 2017, from family jewelers. It was made from yellow gold, size 4.5 to fit my index finger perfectly. The oval cut yellow sapphire was embedded into the center such that the bottom of it touched my skin. This is the story of how I lost it and how I could possible get it back.
